## What is BetterRecycling?
Welcome to BetterRecycling, a plugin that cares about the environment! Recycle handheld items into their corresponding components such that they can be used at a later date to create other, new items. Damaged items only return a limited amount of components based on chance. The chance of retrieving every component gradually decreases as the damage of the item increases.

## Commands
- `/br help`
  - Shows an explanation of the commands
  - `betterrecycling.help`
- `/br recycle` or `/br r`
  - Recycles the item in your hand. The corresponding components are placed in your inventory
  - `betterrecycling.recycle`
